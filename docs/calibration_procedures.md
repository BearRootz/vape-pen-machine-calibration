# Calibration Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the procedures for calibrating machines used in the manufacturing of vape pens, specifically for <a href="https://www.bearrootz.com/quartz-cartridges/" title="Quartz Atomizer Vape Pen Carts">quartz cartridges</a>. The calibration process ensures that the machines operate within optimal parameters, leading to consistent product quality.

## Sensor Integration

### Types of Sensors

- **Temperature Sensors**: Monitor and regulate the temperature within the machine.
- **Pressure Sensors**: Ensure the pressure levels are within the required range.
- **Humidity Sensors**: Control the humidity levels to prevent defects in the cartridges.

## Calibration Process

### Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Initialize Sensors**: Ensure all sensors are properly connected and initialized.
2. **Start Calibration**: Begin the calibration process by activating the sensors.
3. **Read Sensor Data**: Collect data from each sensor to assess the current machine status.
4. **Adjust Machine Settings**: Based on the sensor readings, adjust the machine settings to align with the desired parameters.
5. **Verify Adjustments**: Recheck the sensor readings to confirm that the adjustments are accurate.
6. **Finalize Calibration**: Complete the calibration process and log the settings for future reference.

## Automated Calibration

The system supports automated calibration, reducing human error and ensuring precision. The automated system uses real-time sensor data to continuously monitor and adjust the machine settings.

## Safety and Compliance

Ensure all calibration procedures comply with industry standards and safety regulations. Regular calibration is essential to maintain product quality and operational efficiency.
